In this assignment, you are asked to perform a supervised learning task within the framework of computer vision. In particular, you are given training data in the form of 9-element vectors corresponding to 3x3 grayscale pixel patches, and the corresponding 'true' color of the center pixel. Using this training data, develop an algorithm to color new grayscale images by taking gray pixel data and predicting the correct center color.
