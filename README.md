We are given training data in the form of 9-element vectors corresponding to 3x3 grayscale pixel patches, and the corresponding 'true' color of the center pixel. Using this training data, we are to develop an algorithm to color new grayscale images by taking gray pixel data and predicting the correct center color.

-To run-
In the matlab console:
1. Type "[r,g,b] = getRGB" and press enter.
2. Follow prompt by entering an image address or path in between colons. E.g., "What is the file path? '/Users/Murtala/Desktop/africa.jpg'"
